# warehouse-frontend

Vaasa University of Applied Sciences - Introduction to Programming, Final Assignment

## Task
Develop a mobile-friendly system for the workers of a fictional warehouse. Since databases and backend servers haven't been discussed in this course, most functionalities (such as adding comments, updating orders) are completely dummy. No frameworks such as ReactJS or VueJS were used, the single page application effect is achieved using vanilla JavaScript *(How painful it was? Yes.)*.

## Requirements
- Login page requiring an email address and a password. Since this website would count as a companies internal system, no registration functionality was required.
- Search functionality on the main dashboard *(different criterias such as `is:done` can be used)*.
- Separate order details page. This page includes the comment feature *(making it possible to add comments to the order)* as well as marking the respective order ready/non-ready.
- Print invoice. This can also be done by first clicking on an order, then clicking the **Print** button.
- **`HAS TO BE RESPONSIVE.`** Since in the real world actual warehouse workers often use tablets, this was a key feature.
